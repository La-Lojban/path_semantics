# Mathematical Workflow Visualized

Here I put some flow charts that visualize various aspects of the mathematical workflow.

The mathematical workflow is sometimes a systematic process with creative input in each step.
Even if ideas can emerge sporadically, such moments are often result of thinking hard about the problem for a long time.
Visualizing the mathematical workflow can make it easier to improve the process.

In AI research this is also useful when creating programs that teaches themselves mathematics.
Ideally, we would like to offload as much as work as possible to the computer because there are always new ideas to work on.

It is also worth noticing that not all of mathematics is about abstract thinking. Some of it is about writing down ideas and questions, reading books and papers, brainstorming, programming, organizing information and talking to other people about various topics.
