       "THE BASIC PROBLEM OF ETHICS"
       "by Sven Nilsen, 2018"

 "The basic problem of ethics is to justify an action."

 ,------,  action₀₁ ,------,
 |world₀|---------->|world₁|
 '--,---'           '--,---'
    |                  |
    |evaluation₀       |evaluation₁
    v                  v
 ,--'-----,   ?    ,---'----,
 |utility₀|------->|utility₁|
 '--------'        '--------'

 "A justification is not just comparing two utilities."

 "Since evaluation depends on the world state,"
 "it matters for ethics how the utility is evaluated."

 "Since the world state depends on the action taken,"
 "it matters for ethics how the action changes the world."

 "All these parts matter as a whole:"
 "- How worlds are defined"
 "- How actions are defined"
 "- How evaluations are defined"
 "- How utilities are defined"
 "- What we mean by justifying an action"
```
