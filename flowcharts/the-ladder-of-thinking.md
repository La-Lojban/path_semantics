 "THE LADDER OF THINKING"
 "by Sven Nilsen, 2018"

 (  ...           )   "abstract thinking"
  >--------------<
 (  semantics     )   language     |
  >--------------<                 V    ideas
 (  "proof"       )   theories
  >--------------<              problems  ^
 (  "computation" )   programs            |
  '--------------'

 "A program reads instructions and"
 "makes changes in memory. It must be told"
 "exactly what to do and in which order."

 "A theory modeled as assumptions in logic"
 "makes it possible to answer questions we"
 "not yet have imagined. It is more powerful"
 "than computation, but also much slower."

 "A language consists of more than grammar."
 "What it means is even more important."
 "It is used to point to something yet to be known,"
 "or coordinate actions when interacting with the world."

 "The higher we climb, the harder it gets to"
 "understand what we are doing. This is because"
 "each added layer is used to understand the one"
 "below it. Sometimes, creating a model of what"
 "we are thinking about helps to see the problems."
